## Project Overview

Sky Port Manager enables:
- Admins to manage flight records and view registered passengers.
- Passengers to register, search flights, book or cancel tickets, and view booking history.

Built using Java with OOP principles, this system demonstrates the application of programming to real-world scenarios in airport logistics.

## Key Functionalities

### Administrator
- Add, edit, or delete flight information
- View list of all registered passengers

### Passenger
- Register/Login
- Search available flights by date, destination, or flight number
- Book and cancel flight tickets
- View booking history
- Update personal information

---

## Functional Requirements

- Authentication: Separate login for Admin and Passenger
- Flight Management: Admin can create, update, delete flights
- Ticketing System: Passengers can book/cancel tickets with seat validation
- Search System: Flights searchable by key parameters
- History Tracking: Passengers view past bookings

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Performance: Queries complete within 3 seconds
- Scalability: Multi-user (multi-threaded) support
- Usability: Simple, clean, intuitive GUI
- Security: Role-based access (Admin vs Passenger)
- Reliability: System runs without crashes under normal conditions
- Data Integrity: Prevent duplicate seat bookings
